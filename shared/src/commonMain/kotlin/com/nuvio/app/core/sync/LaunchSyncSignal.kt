/**
 * Observable state of the FULL profile pull [SyncManager] runs right after a profile is selected
 * (`pullAllForProfile` → `startFullProfilePull`) — the "launch sync burst" that lands seconds after
 * cold-launch Home paints. K1's hero-commit gate needs to know whether that burst is still in
 * flight before it will freeze the hero's payload, or the burst's mid-flight `applyFromRemote` /
 * `syncCollections` calls can reorder or reshape Home under a hero that already committed.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow: this tracks ONLY the full profile-select pull, never a foreground
 * (`requestForegroundPull`) or periodic (`startPeriodicNuvioSyncPull`) pull — those can legitimately
 * run minutes after launch, long after the hero has settled, and must not resurrect [Running].
 *
 * [LaunchSyncState.Idle] is the pre-launch default (nothing has happened yet — distinct from
 * [LaunchSyncState.NotApplicable], which is a definite "this profile does not get a launch sync",
 * e.g. signed out or anonymous).
