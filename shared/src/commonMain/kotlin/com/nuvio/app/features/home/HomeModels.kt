     * main thread and then read the repository's live debug string to describe it, so every field
     * in the line (`gate=`, `gateWait=`, `sync=`, `hold=`, `sources=`, `head=`, `prune=`, `rearm=`)
     * could describe a LATER repository state than the `state` it was printed next to. The
     * direction of that skew is a false PASS: a held publish printing `gate=released:all` because
     * the gate released during the dispatch hop reads as a healthy launch in a tester's photo, and
     * a held launch is exactly what the probe exists to catch.
     *
     * Deliberately a body property, not a constructor parameter, on both counts that matter:
     *
     * 1. It is EXCLUDED from `equals`/`hashCode`. Wave H's publish cadence leans on StateFlow
     *    suppressing equal states (a held publish emits an equal [HomeUiState], and every gate
     *    re-evaluation during the hold is one); folding a per-publish diagnostic string into
     *    equality would turn each of those back into a real emission.
     * 2. It keeps the exported initializer's shape, so existing Kotlin and Swift construction sites
     *    are untouched. Kotlin/Native does not carry default arguments into the ObjC initializer.
     *
     * The cost is that `copy()` does not carry it; the one copy site in `HomeRepository.refresh`
     * re-stamps it explicitly. Written once, before the instance is assigned to the state flow, so
     * it never mutates under a reader.
