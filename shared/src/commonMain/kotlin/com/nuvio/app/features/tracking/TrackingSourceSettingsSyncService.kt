/**
 * BUG-75: syncs the tracking source preferences under one namespace every platform reads and

 *
 * Migration / compatibility:
 * - The platform-scoped profile blob still carries `trakt_settings_payload`, and still applies
 *   first in [com.nuvio.app.core.sync.runOrderedProfileSync]. This service's step runs immediately
 *   after it, so a present shared value always wins over the platform-scoped one.
 * - KNOWN mixed-version limitation, deliberate: once the shared namespace exists, an edit made on
 *   an OLD client (which writes only its platform blob) applies transiently during each full sync
 *   and is then overwritten by the shared value — it does not migrate into the shared namespace.
 *   Auto-promoting it was rejected because the promotion signal ("the platform blob moved the
 *   selection") is indistinguishable from a fresh install reading a stale platform blob, and that
 *   case would revert the whole account's setting; true ordering would need timestamps old clients
 *   will never write. The loss is transient (ends when that platform's clients update), and any
 *   edit on an updated client propagates everywhere.
 * - Two clients seeding an absent shared blob simultaneously is likewise resolved last-writer-wins;
 *   both seeds are the clients' own current selections, so the loser's next local change re-pushes.
