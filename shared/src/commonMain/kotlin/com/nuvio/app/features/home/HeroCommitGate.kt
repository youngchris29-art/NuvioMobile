 * BUG-86 (Wave H, the hero commit protocol): the pure decision half of the hero commit gate.
 *
 * The doubled hero is a TEMPORAL double: Home publishes a hero built from whichever catalogs
 * happened to have landed, and then the launch sync burst (addons pull, collections pull, home
 * catalog settings pull) reorders the rows, re-normalizes the hero sources and re-fetches the
 * catalogs a second later, so a SECOND, different hero commits on top of the first. The gate is the
 * fix: [HomeRepository] holds the hero (and the rows that move under it) until every input that can
 * still change the head has settled, then commits once and freezes the payload.
 *
 * This file is deliberately free of repository state so the whole decision table is unit testable
 * (`HeroCommitGateTest`); [HomeRepository] only gathers the inputs and applies the outcome.

 * @param knownDefinitionKeys the keys of the catalog definitions that currently exist.
 * @param outcomes per definition key, the terminal outcome of its fetch this load.
 * @param manifestsPending true while a key in `heroSourceKeys - knownDefinitionKeys` can still turn

 *   one. An addon that already has a manifest and is merely re-fetching it does NOT count: its
 *   catalogs are already in `knownDefinitionKeys`, so waiting on it can only burn the gate's
 *   budget (see `HomeRepository.hasUnresolvedEnabledManifests`).
 * @param syncState the launch sync burst's state (see `LaunchSyncSignal`).
 * @param launchSyncExpected false when this account cannot get a launch sync at all (signed out or
 *   anonymous), which is what makes [LaunchSyncState.Idle] readable as "settled" rather than

 * @param enrichmentPending how many candidate hero items still have a TMDB fetch outstanding.
 * @param candidateEmpty true when the hero candidate list is empty, which can never be a commit.
 *   The candidate is what the publish would actually carry, so it already includes the collection
 *   fallback: a Home whose hero-source catalogs came back empty but whose collection hero resolved
 *   has a NON-empty candidate and commits it (see `heroPublishSource`).
 * @param heroSourcesAllOff true when the profile's stored preferences name catalogs and every one
 *   of them has `heroSourceEnabled = false`: the user deliberately turned every hero source off.
 *   Distinct from an EMPTY [heroSourceKeys] on a profile that simply has no stored selection yet
 *   (`HomeCatalogSettingsRepository.heroSourceKeys` then falls back to the first definitions), and
 *   the difference matters: with every source off no catalog can ever fill the candidate, so
 *   waiting on [candidateEmpty] could only end at the timeout with the same empty hero, four
 *   seconds of held rows later.
 * @param resetRequested an EXPLICIT Hero Sources change from Settings: the user is looking at the
 *   result, so the gate must not make them wait for the burst.
 * @param elapsedMs milliseconds since the gate armed (0 while [HeroGateState.Idle]).
 * @param rowsElapsedMs milliseconds since the repository FIRST evaluated this gate era, armed or
 *   not (BUG-86 hero-off rows, beta.18). Deliberately not [elapsedMs]: the two releases that hold
 *   the rows on their own ([HeroGateReason.HERO_OFF] and [HeroGateReason.NO_SOURCES]) are exactly
 *   the shapes that can answer before, or entirely without, a catalog-bearing refresh, so the only
 *   clock the rows hold can be bounded by is the one that starts at the first evaluation. See
 *   [HeroGateDecision.rowsReleased].

 * releasing [HeroGateReason.NO_SOURCES] here would commit an empty hero on every launch, ahead of
 * the manifests. So the answer is to hold. The point of this function is that the hold is BOUNDED,
 * by the same budget every other launch shape gets.
 *
 * It was not, and that was a real regression. The gate's own [HERO_COMMIT_GATE_TIMEOUT_MS] timer is
 * armed by the first catalog-bearing refresh, so a profile whose enabled add-ons declare no
 * catalogs (a subtitle or stream-only add-on plus collections) never arms it: the only exit was the

/**
 * The gate's whole decision table. Order matters and is part of the contract:
 * hero off, then explicit reset, then timeout, then the readiness conjunction.
 *
 * BUG-86 hero-off rows (beta.18) — why the ROWS can outlive the hero decision.
 *
 * Two of the five reasons answer the hero question WITHOUT consulting a single input:
 * [HeroGateReason.HERO_OFF] (there is no hero to commit) and [HeroGateReason.NO_SOURCES] (no
 * catalog can ever supply one). Both are correct about the hero and both used to open the rows with
 * it, because the rows rode the same boolean. They are not correct about the rows.
 *
 * The rows come out of the very settings the launch sync burst rewrites — `HomeCatalogSettings`'
 * per-catalog `enabled`/`order` and the collection set — so a rows publish taken before the burst
 * lands is a publish of an order that is about to change. On a "Show Hero" OFF profile that is not
 * a cosmetic reshuffle: the top of Home is the FEAT-15 focus panel, whose resting title is the
 * FIRST item of the FIRST catalog row, so reordering the rows underneath repaints the panel with a
 * different title. That is the tester's build-117 photo exactly — rows open at 1.7 s with a
 * collection first, the burst reorders at 2.5 s with a catalog first, and the panel's cover changes
 * with it. The doubled hero this gate was built for, one layer down.
 *
 * So for those two reasons alone the rows keep waiting on [syncSettled], bounded by the same
 * [HeroGateInputs.timeoutMs] budget everything else gets (measured from
 * [HeroGateInputs.rowsElapsedMs], which unlike [HeroGateInputs.elapsedMs] also ticks for a profile
 * that never arms the gate). Every other reason IS a hero commit taken with the burst already
 * folded in, so its rows release with it and [HeroGateDecision.rowsWaiting] reads
 * [HeroGateRowsWait.NONE].
