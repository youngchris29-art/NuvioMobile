/**
 * Builds the provider-aware Continue Watching row shared by the tvOS surfaces.
 *
 * Applies mobile's two gates that the bare [continueWatchingEntries] call omits — the active
 * provider's dropped/hidden-show filter and its recency window — before delegating to
 * [continueWatchingEntries] for per-series dedup, completed-entry removal, recency sort and the cap.
 * Both gates are seam-driven: a provider that does not implement them contributes no filtering, so
 * Trakt (hidden + window), Simkl (hidden only) and NuvioSync (neither) all fall out of the same call.
 *
 * `ContinueWatchingSortMode` is intentionally absent. This row is entry-only, and for an entry-only
 * row all three sort modes degrade to the same recency order — the modes only differ once next-up
 * placeholders join the list.
 *
 * No next-up construction happens here either: tvOS deliberately has no Up Next row.
