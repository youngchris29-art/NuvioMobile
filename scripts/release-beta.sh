Usage:
  ./scripts/release-beta.sh [options]

Builds an unsigned tvOS IPA of NuvioTV and publishes it as a GitHub
prerelease tagged tvos-v<version>-beta.<n> (n auto-increments) on BOTH
youngchris29-art/NuvioMobile and youngchris29-art/NuvioTV (the public
download link points at NuvioTV's releases/latest).

The release notes always include a "What's new" changelog: commit subjects
(first-parent, so an upstream catch-up merge shows as one line) since the
previous tvos-v* tag, plus a compare link. Pass --changelog to prepend
hand-written highlights above the generated list.

Before building, the script checks that the public repo's README.md (or
design/screenshots/) has been touched since the previous tvos-v* release —
every beta must update the README's feature list + screenshots for whatever
it ships. Update the README first, or pass --skip-readme-check for a
hotfix/rebuild that genuinely adds nothing user-facing.

Options:
  --tag <tag>          Use an explicit release tag instead of auto-incrementing
  --changelog <file>   Markdown file with hand-written highlights for the notes
  --reddit-changelog <file>
                       After publishing, swap the "Latest build" block in the
                       r/Nuvio beta thread's post body for this file's contents,
                       so the post always describes what releases/latest serves.
                       Shows a diff and asks before touching the live post; pass
                       --yes to skip the prompt. Needs REDDIT_CLIENT_ID and
                       REDDIT_REFRESH_TOKEN in the environment (plus
                       REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET for a "web app"); get the token once
                       via scripts/update-reddit-beta-post.py --authorize.
                       Write this file by hand: it is public prose for testers,
                       not generated commit subjects.
  --reddit-post <id>   Override the post id (default: the beta thread)
  --yes                Do not prompt before editing the Reddit post
  --skip-build         Reuse the existing build products (repackage + publish only)
  --skip-readme-check  Allow releasing without a README update (hotfixes/rebuilds)
  --dry-run            Build and package, print the notes + what would be published, skip publish
  -h, --help           Show this help

## How to install (no paid Apple Developer account needed)

You sideload this yourself with a **free Apple ID**. The signature is created on your machine at install time.

### Option A — Sideloadly (Mac/Windows)
1. Download \`NuvioTV.ipa\` from the assets below.
2. Install [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/).
3. Make sure your computer and Apple TV are on the same network. Pair the Apple TV if prompted (on the Apple TV: Settings → Remotes and Devices → Remote App and Devices shows the pairing code).
4. Select your Apple TV as the target device in Sideloadly, drag \`NuvioTV.ipa\` in, enter your Apple ID, and hit **Start**.

### Option B — atvloadly (self-hosted / Docker)
See [atvloadly](https://github.com/bitxeno/atvloadly) — a web UI for sideloading to Apple TV over the network, with automatic re-signing.

### First launch
Trust the developer certificate on the Apple TV when prompted (Settings → General → Privacy & Security).

## Free Apple ID limits (normal, not bugs)
- The app signature expires after **7 days** — just re-sideload (Sideloadly's background daemon or atvloadly can auto-refresh).
- Max **3 sideloaded apps** per free Apple ID at once.

## Build info
- Version ${MARKETING_VERSION} (build ${BUILD_NUMBER}), built from \`${HEAD_SHA:0:8}\` on \`${BRANCH}\`
- Includes MPV-based player (MPVKit). The Top Shelf extension is not bundled in the sideload IPA — free-Apple-ID re-signing breaks extension signatures (crashes on tvOS 27), so it ships only in from-source builds.
