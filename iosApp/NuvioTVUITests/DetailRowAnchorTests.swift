/// BUG-96 (beta.18): on the detail page, a vertical focus move must leave every section header
/// either fully on screen or fully off it — never straddling the top edge (the tester's photos:
/// "Guide parental" cut in half above a focused Saga row) — and the focused row's title must rest
/// near `DetailRowAnchor.topInset`.
///
/// BUG-99 (rc6): the direction split changed what "at rest" means for a Down press. Down no
/// longer anchors by default — the engine's own minimal reveal is left alone unless it would
/// leave the header straddling the top scrim — so the Down walk below no longer expects every
/// step to land within ±16 of `DetailRowAnchor.screenRest`; it instead asserts the row never rests
/// ABOVE the rest, and that the probe's `anchor=… free` reading actually fires on at least two of
/// the six presses (proof the new decision is being exercised, not just never triggering). Up is
/// unchanged — it must still anchor every time — so an Up leg is appended after the Down walk to
/// cover that.
///
/// Oracle: XCUI frames of the section-title `staticTexts` at rest after each press. The tvOS
/// 27 runtime never reports `hasFocus`, so the leg does not identify the focused row; it asserts
/// the invariant every title must satisfy, plus that SOME title sits at the anchor band once focus
/// has left the top block. The detail page is recognised by its DEBUG-only `debug_ux6` probe.
