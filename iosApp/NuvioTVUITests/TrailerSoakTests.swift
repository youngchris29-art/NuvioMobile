/// Phase 0 soak harness for the BUG-46 trailer-pipeline leak investigation (and a UX-9 zoom
/// measurement prerequisite — see the plan's 0.7 decision gate). This test doesn't assert
/// anything about the leak itself; it exists to drive rapid dwell/expand/teardown churn across
/// Home's rows while the Phase 0 instrumentation (`TrailerDebugProbes.swift`,
/// `TrailerHeroPlayerView.swift`, `InlineTrailerCard.swift`, `TrailerLocalHLS.swift`) captures
/// `[TrailerPipeline]`/`[TrailerRepack]` log lines. A human/agent harvests and reads that stream
/// afterwards — same philosophy as the rest of this UI-test harness (see `NuvioTVUITests`'
/// type doc: "tests are deliberately tolerant... a human (or agent) reviews the exported
/// attachments afterwards").
///
/// Harvest after the run:
///
///     xcrun simctl spawn booted log show --last 15m \
///       --predicate 'eventMessage CONTAINS "[TrailerPipeline]"'
///
/// (swap the predicate for `"[TrailerRepack]"` to read the token mint/evict/404 stream instead —
/// same trick the UX-4c probes rely on: NSLog lands in unified logging even with no console pty
/// attached, see `TrailerHeroPlayerView.swift`'s `[TrailerQuality]` lines.)
///
/// Helper methods here are a trimmed COPY of `NuvioTVUITests`' (`launchToHome`, `press`, `pause`,
/// `shot`) rather than a shared import — they're `private` to that file, and this harness already
/// accepts duplication over factoring out cross-file test helpers (see
/// `NuvioTVUITests.test18FocusedSettingsRowLegibility`'s doc comment). This copy of
/// `launchToHome` is deliberately simpler: always a fresh `launch()`, no suite-order recovery
/// dance, because every test in this file needs the trailer debug launch arguments to actually be
/// in effect and a `forceFreshLaunch`-style full relaunch is the only way to guarantee that.
