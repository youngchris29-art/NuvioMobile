/// No `publish` line and no `commit` line at all, because `HomeViewModel`'s probe only logged
/// hero-BEARING publishes and there is no hero here. The rows gate opened at 1.7 s on a
/// partially-settled catalog set, the launch sync burst reordered the rows at 2.5 s, and the focus
/// panel repainted with a different title. That is the doubled hero this whole protocol exists to
/// prevent, one layer down — the panel's title is a function of the row order, so gating the hero
/// while leaving the rows free never covered this profile.
///
/// The fix holds the ROWS through a `heroOff`/`noSources` release until the launch sync burst has
/// settled (or the same 4 s budget expires), and adds the hero-empty `publish` probe line that

/// duplication over factoring out cross-file test helpers (same rationale `TrailerSoakTests`
/// states in its own type doc). Like that file's copy, `launchToHome` here is deliberately the
