/// FEAT-42 (2026-09-11): "add the movie logo to the feed selection" — the Home hero/focus panel's
/// title-logo resolution now reaches catalog items the shared TMDB overlay never touched (past
/// `HOME_ROW_ENRICHMENT_PREFIX`, or a TMDB-id catalog the overlay skips entirely), via
/// `HeroArtResolver.logoPlan` + `TitleLogoStore` (`HomeView.swift`). This is an EVIDENCE test, not
/// a hardware-proof one: whether the logo bitmap actually reaches the screen (as opposed to just
/// resolving inside the resolver) depends on the same FEAT-14/BUG-93 lift/ring rendering path every
/// other card treatment does, which the simulator cannot fully stand in for — see the device pass
/// this task's plan owes. What this test DOES pin, off the release-safe `debug_hero`/`hero_probe_blob`
/// probes, live on the fixture: at least one card in a row walk presents its logo FROM THE STORE
/// (`plgs=tmdb plg=1`), most of the row's cards resolve rather than sitting at `none`, the
/// presented item and the focused item agree, `plgs` and `plg` never disagree about whether a
/// bitmap is on screen, a warm revisit of the proof card still presents a logo, and the probe's
/// `present` lines carry the `logoSrc=` field with no `same=1` repaint signature and no
/// back-to-back commit of one item.
///
/// rc12 (Codex Finding B) rewrote the walk to fail with the collected `(fitem, plgs, plg)` table
/// instead of skipping on an all-`none` walk. The launch was still opportunistic, though: `logoPlan`
/// prefers a card's own logo (the Kotlin row overlay fills `item.logo` for a row's leading items)
/// and then the synchronous metahub guess for IMDb ids, so `plgs=tmdb` only ever showed up by
/// timing luck — a card whose own logo or metahub guess resolved first never reached the store at
/// all. Codex round 4 also flagged that the table-based warm read could BE the proof read itself
/// (when the proof only turned up on the back pass) and that the navigation fallback's backward-step
/// arithmetic was measured from the wrong edge.
///
/// This version removes the luck entirely: the app is launched with `debug.heroLogoStoreOnly`
/// (`#if DEBUG`-only, see `HeroArtResolver.heroLogoStoreOnly`'s doc comment in `HomeView.swift`),
/// which makes `present` pass `logoPlan` `addonLogo: nil` and `allowMetahub: false` — so a logo can
/// only ever come from `TitleLogoStore`, and every read's `plgs` can only ever be `tmdb` or `none`.
/// With the faster candidates out of the way, one row is enough: no second-row fallback, no
/// cross-row navigation. The proof is now a table-wide count (at least one card resolved through
/// the store, and resolved cards are not a minority), not a single lucky hit.
///
/// ⚠️ Pass `-debug.heroLogoStoreOnly YES` as a LAUNCH ARGUMENT only, the way this test does —
/// never persist it on the fixture simulator with `defaults write`. It withholds a card's own
/// logo and the metahub guess for every hero commit while it's set, folder heroes included, which
/// would silently break the evidence every OTHER hero UI test relies on for as long as it stuck
/// around outside this one launch.
///
/// This test has exactly two skip paths, both retained from before: (1) an explicit
/// `-debug.assumeTmdbOff` on the runner — TMDB is deliberately off, so `plgs=tmdb` is unreachable
/// by construction; (2) no non-folder row focused within 20 Down presses — this profile's Home has
/// nothing walkable to begin with, not a code question.
///
/// Helpers below are a trimmed copy of `NuvioTVUITests`'s (`pause`/`press`/`launchToHome`/
/// `moveFocus`/`openTab`/`heroProbeLines`/`probeField`/`probeKind`/`readHeroProbeAboutPane`) — see
