/// `StillCardButtonStyle` + `.focusEffectDisabled(true)` — zero system lift, `PosterCard.swift`
/// ~L196-210), accent ring OFF, Card Depth ON, the inline poster trailer spills past the poster's
/// edge — but only on the FIRST (left-most) card of a row. Root cause: the row's horizontal
/// `ScrollView` runs `.scrollClipDisabled()` (`BrowseComponents.swift` ~L3107), so any bleed a
/// focused card puts outside its own layout frame lands on top of its LEFT neighbour and is
/// invisible everywhere except at card #1, which has no neighbour to hide behind — the empty
/// overscan margin left of the row shows it plainly. `RowLeadingEdgeClip`
/// (`NuvioTV/DesignSystem/RowLeadingEdgeClip.swift`) is the fix; see that type's header for the
/// exact `BrowseComponents.swift` attachment this repo's DesignSystem wave does NOT itself touch.
///
/// Card Depth is deliberately left at its default (untouched by either launch-argument leg below):
/// its rail/shadow draw strictly INSIDE the tile's own `.clipShape` (`CardDepthStyle.swift`), so it
/// has no bearing on bleed PAST the tile's edge — the reporter's "Card Depth ON" is incidental to
/// this bug, not a precondition of it.
///
/// Helper methods here are a trimmed COPY of `NuvioTVUITests`'/`TrailerSoakTests`'/
/// `InlineTrailerTileProbeTests`' (`launchToHome`, `press`, `pause`, `shot`) — same house rule those
/// give for why cross-file UI-test helpers stay duplicated rather than factored out.
