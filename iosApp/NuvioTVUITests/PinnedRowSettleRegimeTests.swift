/// Wave W5 (beta.18): the two BUG-87/BUG-89 defects the tester reported on build 117, gated through
/// the app's own geometry rather than pixels.
///
///  - **BUG-89, the Medium → Large regression.** After switching Poster Size in Settings, the
///    second-to-last row's regression comes back and stays back until the app is restarted, and the
///    correction — when it finally happens — reads as an "oops" snap rather than part of the size
///    change. Cause: the corrector's brakes (`disarmed`, `verifyFailures`, `pullBacks`,
///    `pullBackDisarmed`, `correctionsFired`, `lastCorrection` in `PinnedRowSettle`) are session-wide
///    statics that nothing reset short of process start, so evidence gathered under Medium's
///    geometry switched the corrector off for a regime it had never been tried against — leaving
///    only the belt, whose one tool is to hide the title. `PinnedRowSettle.noteRegimeChange(key:fits:)`
///    is the fix; leg A is its gate.
///  - **BUG-87, the vanished title.** On the tester's FIRST launch of build 117 a row title
///    disappeared entirely and a relaunch brought it back. Cause: the belt arms on a title's very
///    first `Reading`, which on a cold launch is routinely measured mid-fan-out, and recovery is
///    measurement-driven — on an untouched Home nothing fires another geometry pass, so the hide is
///    permanent. The first-reading grace and the recovery watchdog (`PinnedRowTitleTracking`,
///    `BrowseComponents.swift`) are the fix; leg B is its gate.
///
/// **Oracle: `debug_pinned`, the app's own settle line** — the same one test47/test48 read, for the
/// same reason those two give at length: the pinned title is offset by a `visualEffect`, which is a
/// RENDER-time transform invisible to layout, so its AX frame reports an un-slid position and a
/// frame-based check would pass while the rendered title sat on the artwork. `debug_pinned` carries
/// the geometry the corrector actually decided on, plus (Wave W5) the appended `regime=`/`fits=`
/// fields this file is mostly about. Screenshots are attached for review either way.
///
/// **Both legs skip LOUDLY rather than pass vacuously.** Poster Size is a SYNCED profile setting
/// with no launch-argument override (unlike `no_zoom_on_focus` and friends), so leg A cannot put the
/// fixture where it needs it — it can only read `debug_env`, say plainly that the fixture is in the
/// wrong state, and name the change that would fix it. That is test47's precedent verbatim.
///
/// Helper methods here are a trimmed COPY of `NuvioTVUITests`' (`shot`, `pause`, `press`,
/// `launchToHome`, `moveFocus`, `moveToSidebarRow`, `openTab`, `focusedButton`, `probeValue`,
/// `probeToken`) rather than a shared import — they are `private` to that file, and this harness
/// already accepts duplication over factoring out cross-file test helpers (the rationale
/// `TrailerSoakTests`, `RowLeadingEdgeTests` and `HeroOffLaunchTests` all state in their own type
/// docs). Like those copies, `launchToHome` here is deliberately the always-fresh-`launch()` form:
/// every assertion below depends on a COLD launch with the debug arguments actually in effect,
/// which the suite-order recovery dance in `NuvioTVUITests` cannot guarantee.
