///
/// A reorder is two row ids present in BOTH lines that swap relative position. Rows growing as
/// catalog batches stream in is not a reorder and never was; this rule only ever looks at ids the
/// two lines share.
///
/// The rule is NOT "rows never reorder". `RowsGate` (HomeHeroCommit.swift) is explicit that the
/// gate exists to make the FIRST paint atomic - hero, sections and rows in one turn - and that
/// afterwards "post-commit reorders are allowed by design". The thing BUG-86 is about is a rebuild
/// that reshuffles the rows BEFORE the hero has committed (the tester's video: "Top 10 des films"
/// on top, then a rebuild that puts "Nouveaux films" first, with skeletons under it).
///
/// So a reorder is accepted only when all three hold:
///   1. it is OBSERVED after the first `commit` line (the later of the two `rows` lines is
///      post-commit). The gated rebuild's own `rows` line is logged from inside the commit
///      continuation, immediately BEFORE the `commit` line, so it is always the `earlier` half of
///      the pair that matters and this stays a strict pre/post split;
///   2. `settingsSig=` actually MOVED between the two lines, i.e. the Home Rows order the rebuild
///      walks is a different order now. That is what makes the reorder attributable to a settings
///      publish (a cloud pull landing the order the user set on another device - the launch sync
///      burst's step 2, and the real event it simulates) rather than to rows reshuffling under a
///      settings order that never moved, which is an unstable rebuild and stays a failure. A line
///      with no `settingsSig=` (a log from a build before this token) can attribute nothing, so it
///      is rejected exactly as it was before this rule existed;
///   3. nothing disqualifying sits between them - a second `commit`, or a `publish … headChanged=1`.
///      Either means the reorder rode a re-decision of the hero head, which is the double-commit
///      the whole photo contract exists to catch, and no settings change excuses it.

    ///
    /// **Two abandoned repro attempts, both worth keeping so they are not retried.**
    ///
    /// 1. A straight-down walk (2026-08-31 run #1). It settled at `margin=+24 net=+24 deficit=0` —
    ///    a healthy top-visible rest where `beltFaded=0` is the CORRECT answer. Downward reveals

    ///    `net=-78 intr=-25 beltFaded=0` — and that is ALSO correct behaviour, for a reason worth
    ///    stating: pinning the slide at 2pt leaves the title fully clipped ABOVE the edge, i.e.
    ///    invisible, with zero artwork contamination. `PinnedRowTitle.reading`'s `stillOnScreen`
    ///    term stands the belt down there by design — there is nothing on the poster to hide. The

    ///    defect is a title that is PARTIALLY visible and sitting on artwork, which a cap that
    ///    small cannot produce. The override is gone from this test entirely.
    ///
    /// Wave 10 update: the fix removed this geometry from the simulator entirely, in two steps,
    /// and leg A now recreates both.
    ///
    /// The first attempt was `-debug.pinnedSettleDisarm YES` alone — turn the corrector off so a
    /// deep park stays unfixed. That was not enough, and the 2026-09-01 run said why in the
    /// clearest possible terms: `vh=524`. The hero compression had already given the rows the
    /// 68pt they were short, so every down→up park settled HEALTHY at `margin≈+22` with nothing
    /// for a corrector to fix or a belt to hide. The premise guard failed for the best available
    /// reason — production geometry now fits.
    ///
    /// So the leg also passes `-debug.pinnedHeroCompressionOff YES`, which returns the pinned hero
    /// to its pre-Wave-10 height and the rows viewport to ~455. That is honest archaeology rather
    /// than a synthetic construction: the belt is being tested against the exact device geometry it
    /// was built for, the geometry the Living Room ATV produced and the tester filmed. A safety net
    /// still has to work when the thing it nets against comes back — past the compression cap, on
    /// mixed-shape extremes, or on whatever the next device's rests turn out to be.
    ///
    /// The pairing also buys coverage the natural version never had: with no corrector there is no
    /// stand-down either, so the belt must arrive via its `rest`/`ceiling` TIMER paths — the ones
    /// the Wave 9b fast path bypasses on every naturally-unfixable rest.
    ///
    /// Leg B deliberately runs with NEITHER knob: today's real geometry, a healthy rest, and the
    /// belt leaving it alone.
    ///
    /// What reproduces the deep park is the natural geometry: go one or two rows PAST a row and come
    /// back UP into it. An upward reveal bottom-anchors the focused frame, and a Large focusable
    /// frame (~579pt) bottom-anchored in the ~455pt rows viewport necessarily parks its top — and
