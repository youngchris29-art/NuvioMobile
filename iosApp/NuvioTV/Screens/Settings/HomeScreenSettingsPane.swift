/// 2026-08-30 fix: "Hero Sources" and "Catalogs" used to be single composite child views
/// (`HeroSourcesGroup`/`HomeCatalogsGroup`), each rendering a disclosure header PLUS every

/// toggle row and every catalog chip permanently unreachable — down from an expanded header
/// skipped straight to the next section row, and right did nothing. This is the root cause behind
/// the beta tester's repeated "impossible to select the catalogs for the home page or the Hero"
/// report across three betas (reproduced in the simulator 2026-08-29/30). The fix hoists every
/// expanded row to be a direct `SettingsSection` child in its own right — see the per-view

/// params, no `settingsRowPlatterActive`/`settingsRowIsFocused` reads, no `colorScheme` flip. It
/// used to take a `@FocusState` binding from its parent group so the group could tell whether ITS
/// one List row's platter was up (BUG-65 container half), because the header shared that List row
/// with every expanded child. Now this row is its OWN `SettingsSection` child, i.e. its own List
/// row, so the system's native focused-row label inversion reaches the whole Button label the
/// ordinary way every other kit row gets it — the same way `SettingsActionRow` always has. That
/// retires the container-focus problem for this file specifically (BUG-65's platter-legibility
/// fix, the env keys in DesignSystem/FlatControlStyles.swift, and the `@FocusState`-publishing
/// pattern all still apply to other custom containers elsewhere in the app — nothing here changes
