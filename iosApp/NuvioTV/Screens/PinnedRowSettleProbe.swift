/// BUG-89 / BUG-66 (beta.18-rc2, Steven's video): a release-safe, PHOTOGRAPHABLE record of what
/// Home's pinned-row settle machinery decided — the same evidence a `[HomeScrollProbe]` device log
/// carries, for a tester who has a sideload and a TV and no console.
///
/// Why a second probe rather than more lines in `HomeHeroProbe`. They answer different questions
/// and are captured under different protocols: the hero probe's contract is a COLD LAUNCH left
/// untouched for 90 seconds, and its head-preserving buffer freezes exactly that launch window.
/// The settle evidence is the opposite shape — it only exists once the tester WALKS the rows, and
/// the interesting lines are the ones produced minutes after launch. Mixing them would push one
/// out of the other's photo. So: same mechanism, own key, own buffer, own toggle
/// (`debug.pinnedRowSettleProbe`), and deliberately independent of `HomeGeometryProbe.enabled` so
/// a tester can capture rests without also turning the console firehose on.
///
/// Relationship to the existing `[HomeScrollProbe]` NSLogs: none. This type NEVER NSLogs. Every
/// call site keeps its own `HomeGeometryProbe.enabled`-gated NSLog exactly as it was — the console
/// contract and its tokens are unchanged — and simply mirrors the same text in here when this
/// probe is on. Routing the NSLog through this type instead would have doubled every line whenever
/// both knobs were set, and would have changed what a device console prints, which is the one
/// thing a diagnostics change must not do.
///
/// Head/tail sizing, against the capture protocol ("relaunch, walk down every row on Home and back
/// up, then photograph this pane"): a 6-row walk down and back is ~12 focus hops, each of which
/// resolves ONE settle decision, plus a launch `regime`/`plan` pair and a handful of belt events.
/// 12 frozen head lines hold the launch regime and the first few rests; the 28-line rolling tail
/// holds the end of the walk, which is where the last row's rest lives. 41 displayed lines total.
