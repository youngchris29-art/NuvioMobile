///
/// On hardware, with the pinned hero and the rows resting ~100pt deeper on an up-walk than on the
/// way down (see `PinnedRowSettle`'s header and BUG-112), row 1 ends entirely above the rows
/// viewport and tvOS refuses to focus it: the Up press resolves to no candidate, the engine
/// consumes nothing, and SwiftUI hands the move to the focused view chain — where `HomeView`'s
/// `.onMoveCommand` now reveals and focuses the previous row itself. This file carries the two
/// pieces that cannot live in `HomeView`: the request value the rows observe, and the one-line
/// modifier each row applies to its OWN `@FocusState`.
///
/// Why the row's own FocusState and not a Home-owned one applied to the cards: a second
/// `.focused` binding on a card collides with the row's (CollectionsUI.swift's `stillFocused`
/// comment records the device rounds that established this), and a Home-side `.focusScope` +
/// `resetFocus` would declare a new focus container over the rows — the change class that broke
/// test54's row walk when the shell scope was declared in both chrome modes (ContentView.swift).
///
/// Inert outside Home: nothing but `HomeView` ever writes `pinnedRowFocusRequest`, its default
/// carries `rowKey == nil`, and `onChange` on a value that never changes costs a comparison per
/// environment publish. Search's and Library's `CatalogRowView`s are untouched.
