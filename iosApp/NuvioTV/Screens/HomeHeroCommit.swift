// MARK: - Hero commit coordinator (Wave H, BUG-86 "doubled hero")
//
// `HomeRepository.HeroCommitGate` (Kotlin, see `HeroCommitGate.kt`) decides WHEN the hero payload
// is allowed to move: it holds `heroItems`/`sections` behind `HomeUiState.heroGateReleased` until
// every input that could still move the head (hero-source catalogs, the launch sync burst, TMDB
// enrichment) has settled, then commits once and freezes the payload for the session.
//
// This file is the Swift half. `HomeViewModel.homeWatcher` uses `HeroCommitCoordinator` to decide,
// per publish, whether to hold, update rows only, or commit a genuinely new head — and when it
// commits, `prepare(_:)` prewarms the head's own backdrop + logo BEFORE `heroItems`/`sections` are
// assigned, so the very first frame that shows the committed hero already has its artwork (or has
// waited `artTimeout` and is painting deliberately without it) instead of painting text over a
// blank/stale backdrop and catching up a beat later (BUG-86 phenomena B/C).

/// Testing seam for the artwork operations `HeroCommitCoordinator.prepare(_:)` depends on. Defaults
/// to the real `ArtworkStore` (`DesignSystem/CachedAsyncImage.swift`) via `ArtworkStoreHeroFetcher`;
/// `HeroCommitCoordinatorTests` injects a stub so `.timeout`/`.failed` outcomes are producible
/// deterministically, without a network.

/// burst, so the holes the gate closes never open there).
///
/// Same pairing rule as `TrailerProbe.forceNoTrailer` (`Screens/TrailerDebugProbes.swift:49-54`):
/// read once, logged once, honored only when `HomeHeroProbe.enabled` is ALSO true — a stray
/// persisted launch arg must never silently mutate a release sideload's local Home ordering (the
/// burst PERSISTS its row/collection reordering locally; see `HomeLaunchBurstSim.kt`'s warning).
