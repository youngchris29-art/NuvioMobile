/// BUG-96 (beta.18): the detail page's rows had no resting place. The page is a plain vertical
/// `ScrollView`, each row is a title above a horizontal shelf of cards, and the cards are the only
/// focusable frames — so a vertical focus move scrolled by exactly the minimum tvOS needed to reveal
/// the focused card, and wherever that left the top edge was incidental. The tester's photos: the
/// film's Saga row focused, and the "Guide parental" header two rows up cut in half under the top
/// edge. Official Nuvio's Compose TV list pivots the focused row to a fixed viewport fraction, so
/// headers above scroll off whole.
///
/// The fix anchors the FOCUSED ROW to a fixed top inset. The first shipped version (build 121,
/// `46ab30f0`) let the engine's own reveal run to completion, then slid the row to its rest after
/// a fixed `settleDelay` — which is exactly a land-then-nudge, and rc5 (u/mrStevenx3) caught it:
/// one Down press visibly scrolled in two steps on every movie. The fix BLENDS instead of
/// following: on a focused-row change, `DetailView` arms a flag and waits for the very first
/// scroll-geometry frame that shows the engine has actually started moving the page, then issues
/// the anchor's own animated `scrollTo(y:)` immediately — so the engine's reveal and the anchor
/// move run as one continuous motion instead of two. A short fallback timer
/// (`blendFallbackDelay`) covers the case where the focused card was already fully visible and the
/// engine never moves the page at all (nothing to blend with, so the anchor just fires on its
/// own). There is nothing here for the two to fight over once blended — no pinned header, no
/// compression, and every row is far shorter than the viewport, so the engine's rest is unique and
/// ours simply supersedes it.
