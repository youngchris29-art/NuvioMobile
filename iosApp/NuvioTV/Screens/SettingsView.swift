/// The Settings tab: a two-pane split — a native `List` of categories on the left (~1/3), the
/// selected category's pane rendered inside a native `List` on the right (~2/3), under one page
/// title. Each category's rows live in their own `*SettingsPane` file; the shared row primitives
/// live in Settings/SettingsRowViews.swift.
///
/// beta.15 §C (C2): this was a hand-rolled `HStack` of custom `SettingsRowButtonStyle` buttons in
/// a `ScrollView`. Everything focus- and colour-related is now the system's job — no custom
/// `ButtonStyle`, no `hoverEffect`, no focus-derived label colours (the BUG-45 sidebar
/// special-case and the BUG-65 published-focus-environment-key hack are gone from this file).
///
/// ## Focus graph (written before the code, per the tvOS skill's workflow)
///
/// **Default focus.** The sidebar `List` is a `.focusScope(sidebarFocus)`; the SELECTED category
/// row carries `.prefersDefaultFocus(true, in: sidebarFocus)` — on a cold mount that is the first
/// row (Account & Services), and after a theme-change remount it is whichever category the user
/// was standing in, so picking a theme swatch no longer throws them to the top. Entering the
/// Settings tab — from the tab bar, or back from a pushed sub-page — lands focus on a sidebar
/// row, never in the detail pane. There is no `@FocusState` write on appear: the scope's default
/// is the only mechanism, so a restored focus (tvOS remembers the last focused row within the
/// tab) still wins where the system wants it to.
///
/// **Sidebar.**
/// - Up / Down walk the seven categories. Focus *is* selection: `onChange(of: focusedCategory)`
///   writes `selectedCategory`, so the detail pane live-previews the focused category (the
///   Settings.app behaviour the old screen had, kept deliberately).
/// - Up from the first row leaves the list upward and lands on the app's tab bar (the standard
///   tvOS top-edge exit). Down from the last row does nothing — the list ends.
/// - Left does nothing: the sidebar is the leading edge of the screen.
/// - Right enters the detail `List` and lands on its first focusable row.
///
/// **Detail.**
/// - Up / Down walk the rows and sections; the `List` scrolls to reveal.
/// - Left from any row returns to the sidebar, on the row that is still selected (the sidebar
///   keeps its focus memory, so the walk resumes where it left off).
/// - Right does nothing at row level. Inside a row it is the control's own business: a `Toggle`
///   ignores it, a `Menu { Picker }` opens on Select, not on Right.
/// - Up from the first detail row leaves upward to the tab bar; Down from the last does nothing.
///
/// **Empty / error panes (BUG-47 class).** A pane whose `List` has no focusable row cannot be
/// entered: Right from the sidebar is a no-op and focus stays on the category row — it is never
/// stranded, and Menu still exits cleanly. Every pane today has at least one focusable control in
/// every state (e.g. Advanced offers "Start Remote Setup" when the server is stopped), and every
/// pushed sub-page a `SettingsLinkRow` presents must keep one too.
///
/// **Menu.** Exactly one level per press, all of it the system's default — this file installs no
/// `onExitCommand` anywhere. Inside an open `Menu`/`Picker` popover it dismisses the popover; on a
/// page pushed by a `SettingsLinkRow` it pops back to the detail list; at the `NavigationStack`
/// root (the split itself) it leaves Settings for the app's tab bar. An `.alert` is dismissed by
/// its own Cancel button.
