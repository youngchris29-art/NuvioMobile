/// DEVICE produces, not just the exact ones the simulator produces.
///
/// Why round 8's compromise wasn't enough. The title is overlaid `heroPinnedRowTitleInset` (48)
/// below the SHELF's top; the focusable card frame the engine's scroll-to-reveal aligns starts
/// `Spacing.lg` (24) below that same shelf top, inside the shelf's own padding. So the static
/// margin between "the engine rested the card frame's top at the viewport edge" and "the title's
/// top" is 48 − 24 = 24pt — round 8 read the inset against the shelf and recorded it as ~48. The
/// device's measured rest error is 40–67pt short (`[HomeScrollProbe]`, 1,603 samples, 2026-08-02:
/// rest y=-90 vs true top -157), so the title clears on the sim and is cut on hardware.
///
/// Why NOT card-anchoring the title (moving it inside the button's label), which is the obvious
/// "it moves with the card" fix. It buys nothing here: the shelf never scrolls vertically, so the
/// title and the cards are already rigid with respect to each other — re-anchoring changes which
/// edge the inset is measured from, not the geometry. The band above the art is 96pt whichever
/// anchor you pick, the title is ~40pt, so the best static margin either way is ~32pt, still under
/// the envelope. And it would spend the structural invariants rounds 5–7 paid for: label content
/// has to be compensated by paddings that stay POSITIVE (negative compensation put focusable
/// frames outside their `.focusSection()` and froze directional resolution), a per-card overlay
/// would draw the title once per card, and any extra band means a reach above 72 — the sim
/// bisected 100 as where focus resolution dies.
///
/// What happens instead: the title stays exactly where round 8 put it at a true rest, and slides
/// DOWN by however much the viewport's top edge has eaten into it, clamped to
/// `heroPinnedRowTitleMaxSlide`. BUG-61 (beta.12) changed the HOW, not the WHAT: the slide is now
/// measured via `onGeometryChange` and applied as an eased offset (see `PinnedRowTitleTracking`)
/// instead of a draw-time `visualEffect`, because the draw-time recompute snapped the title in one
/// frame whenever a focus-driven reveal shifted layout discretely. The `@State` this introduces is
/// change-gated and confined to the title's own subtree — rows resting clear of the clip edge
/// measure a constant 0 and write nothing, so the BUG-19 no-identity-churn rule still holds. At
/// 0pt of rest error nothing moves and the look is byte-identical to beta.10; across the whole
/// 0–67pt envelope the title parks against the clip edge instead of disappearing behind it; past
/// the clamp (a row scrolled well above the focused one) it releases and scrolls away like any
/// other content, i.e. it behaves as a sticky header for exactly as long as its row is on screen.

/// Corrects the one rest the BUG-37 slide provably cannot cover: a SETTLED pinned rest whose title
/// is still clipped after the slide has saturated.
///
/// The measurement that specified this, on the FA87 sim fixture at Poster Size = **Large**
/// (2026-08-30): a focused poster row at a settled rest logs
/// `[HomeScrollProbe] title row=…recs_series_for_you margin=-86..-100 slide=72 net=-14..-28
/// cap=64 intr=46`. The row's top parks ~90–100pt UNDER the pinned clip edge, the slide saturates
/// at the absolute 72 cap, and `net` goes NEGATIVE — violating the invariant the probe's own doc
/// names as the regression to watch (`net ≥ 0` at a settled rest). At Medium the frame fits and
/// none of it fires, which is exactly the tester's "only at Large".
///
/// Why the fix has to move the SCROLL and not the title. The focusable link frame at Large is
/// `artworkHeight + 175.5` = 578.8pt; the reveal regime documented at `PosterCard.swift` (~L730)
/// parks frames of that class UNDER the clip edge instead of centring them. Once the rest is
/// 90pt short, every render-time dial is already spent: the slide is at its cap, and raising the
/// cap trades a title on the artwork for a title cut off screen (Codex 2026-08-29 P1 settled
/// that trade the other way). The row is simply in the wrong place, so the row is what moves.
/// `954d62a9` deferred exactly this ("settle re-reveal"); this is that deferred work.
///
/// **Wave G (BUG-87, beta.18) replaced the target and added two brakes.** The tester's beta.17
/// report — "the row titles are constantly trying to move back" — is this corrector, unbounded.
/// What was wrong, precisely:
///
///  - Wave 10 aimed at a POINT (`margin == 0`, the "canonical rest"). That held on the simulator
///    because the sim's focus engine TOP-anchors an over-tall link frame and rests at +22, so one
///    contraction finished the job. Hardware BOTTOM-anchors the same frame on an up-walk: the
///    recorded device rest is `margin=-99` at `vh=455`, which is `vh − H + 24` to within a point.
///    The two anchorings sit ~55pt apart and NO point target with a ±4 dead zone can hold both.
///  - The 2-nudge budget counted CONSECUTIVE FAILURES and `deficit == 0` refunded it. A landed
///    correction produces exactly `deficit == 0`, so the budget handed itself back every time it
///    was successfully spent. The loop then needed nothing exotic: correct → land → refund → the
///    engine re-reveals the frame to its own anchoring → motion → arm → correct, forever. The
///    session self-disarm could never accumulate against it either, because a focus change nils
///    `pendingVerification` and any reflow VOIDs it.
///  - The belt could not mask it: at the corrected rest the title is fine, so it shows again. The
///    user therefore sees the title MOVE rather than disappear, which is the report verbatim.
///  - Independently, `protectedBottom` ignored the shelf's own 24pt bottom padding, so every
///    downward correction at Large stopped ~11.5pt short and stood down on `bound` — the
///    "almost, give up, the engine moves it, almost…" cadence.
///  - And a MOTIONLESS geometry pass still armed a settle whenever nothing was armed, so lazy row
///    realization on a row-heavy Home fired corrections with no scroll behind them at all.
///
/// The mechanism now, and why it terminates:
///
///  1. **It only ever runs from a settled rest, and only after real motion.** `noteScroll` arms a
///     single debounce and now REQUIRES motion to arm at all; a real scroll (motion beyond
///     `driftTolerance`, or a path length beyond `motionWindowDisplacement`) re-arms it, so
///     nothing fires while the page moves and nothing fires when the page has not moved. The three
///     backstops that legitimately arm without motion (`invalidateEpoch`, `noteClearances`,
///     `noteBeltFaded`) call `rearm(source:)` directly and are unaffected; `armSrc=` on the settle
///     line names which one did.
///  2. **The target is a legibility BAND, not a point.** Both edges come from the row's own
///     geometry:
///
///         bandLow  = −clearance.focused
///         bandHigh = min(heroPinnedRowTitleInset,
///                        heroPinnedRowTitleInset + vh − lockupExtent − settledCushion)
///
///     `bandLow` is BUG-84's edge — the title's bottom exactly on the FOCUSED card's artwork top,
///     with the focus lift already subtracted into `clearance.focused`. `bandHigh` is the title's
///     own inset (past it the previous row starts showing under the fold, BUG-89's contrast) met
///     with "the focused card's lockup still finishes inside the viewport with the cushion under
///     it". `inBand` carries ±2 of slack, the probe's own quantization. Outside the band the
///     correction aims one dead zone INSIDE the nearer edge, never past the midpoint, so a landed
///     rest cannot sit on a boundary and re-trigger on noise; inside it, `err` and `deficit` are 0
///     and nothing happens. An EMPTY band (`bandHigh < bandLow`) is unsatisfiable geometry:
///     `standDown(reason: "unsatisfiable")`, `unsat=1`, and the belt owns it.
///

///     would ask to scroll past the end, `scrollTo` would clamp it silently, and two such MISSes
///     would set the session-wide disarm).
///  4. **A WALL-CLOCK budget that success cannot refund.** At most `maxCorrectionsPerWindow` (2)
///     corrections per row per `correctionWindow` (8s), counted from when each FIRED. This is the
///     brake the consecutive-failure counter could not be: the loop's corrections all succeed.
///     `standDown(reason: "budget")`, `budget=1`. `consecutiveNudges` survives only as the `n=`
///     field and nothing branches on it.
///  5. **A PULL-BACK detector.** Each correction records the margin it was fired FROM. If the next
///     settle for the same row lands within `pullBackTolerance` of that margin inside two seconds,
///     the correction achieved nothing and repeating it would achieve nothing either: log
///     `PULLBACK`, `standDown(reason: "pullback")` so the belt hides the title within ~0.25s, and
///     report `pullback=1` (the running total is the line's own `pull=` field). Two pull-backs in
///     a session set `pullBackDisarmed` with a loud `DISARMED-PULLBACK` line and the corrector is
///     off for good, belt only. The ACTION sits after the in-band branch, so a rest that landed
///     inside the band is never scored as a fight.
///
///     Worst case on a device that fights: one 0.5s nudge-and-return per row for two rows, then
///     static. Before Wave G: unbounded.
///  6. **At most one correction in flight** (`nudgeDeadline`), and **focus changes abandon it**. A
///     new focused row replaces the measurement, ends the epoch and clears `lastCorrection`; focus
///     leaving the rows clears it outright, so a correction planned for one row can never land on
///     another. That includes TOKENS already scheduled: `invalidateEpoch` bumps `generation`, so a
///     debounce armed for the old row cannot fire against the new row's not-yet-settled
///     measurement, and it re-arms a fresh settle so the new row gets its own full `settleDelay`
///     (Codex r3 P2-2). The tracked focus covers a catalog row's trailing See All tile too, which
///     is part of the row and needs the same correction (Codex r3 P2-1). The per-row WINDOW BUDGET
///     deliberately does NOT reset on a focus change: it is keyed by row and its whole purpose is
///     to outlive the epoch churn that refunded the old counter.
///  7. **It self-disarms if it is ever wrong.** Each correction records where it asked the scroll
///     view to land; the next settle checks. Two misses and the whole mechanism switches off for
///     the session with a loud log line, leaving beta.15 behavior plus the belt. Only a correction
///     whose own epoch is still current can testify: a focus change voids the outstanding
///     verification (`invalidateEpoch`), and a content reflow between fire and check voids it too
///     — otherwise a D-pad move or a lazy row realization would be counted as evidence against the
///     scroll API and two of them would disarm the session (Codex r1 P2, both seen in a sim run).
///
/// Two earlier targets are recorded because both were wrong in instructive ways: gating on raw
/// `margin` was Codex r1 P1 (it fired on already-clean `margin=-25 net=0` rests), and gating on
/// PRE-LIFT intrusion was Codex r4 P1 (its fixpoint still left the focused card's artwork ~20pt
/// under the title). The band subsumes both — every margin in it clears the FOCUSED card's
/// artwork by construction.
///
/// **The handoff, and why it cannot livelock (Wave 9(a), device pass on the Living Room ATV).**
/// Some rests are simply UNSATISFIABLE: hardware parks rows deeper than the simulator does
/// (tab-bar occlusion, the BUG-66 family — device `margin=-99 rowB=480` against sim `-25 / 404` at
/// the same `vh=455`), and a Large focusable frame taller than the effective viewport cannot be
/// made to show its title band AND its card at once. No amount of correcting fixes that; the
/// visibility belt (`PinnedRowTitleTracking`) is the terminal fallback, and the corrector's job is
/// to get out of its way.
///
/// It did not, at first, and the failure is worth keeping because it was a genuine LIVELOCK rather
/// than a wrong number. The device trace ran `nudge=19 bound=19 n=1`, then `n=2`, then handed its
/// budget straight back and started over — because a transient unmeasurable geometry pass (lazy
/// row realization, `contentH` climbing 17449→20650 across the walk) used to `clear` the focused
/// row, which ends the epoch and resets `consecutiveNudges`. Each re-fired correction animated for
/// 0.25s and stamped `lastMotionAt`; the reveal pulled the rest back to the same `margin=-99`; and
/// the belt's rest-gate never saw its 0.7s of stillness, so a title sat on the artwork for as long
/// as the tester watched. The disarm that should have noticed corrections weren't landing was
/// itself neutralized — the same content growth VOIDed every verification, so no MISS was counted.
///
/// Three changes closed it, and each is sufficient on its own for a different reason:
///   - `MeasurementReport.unmeasured` HOLDS instead of clearing, so the stand-down sticks. This is
///     the root cause; the rest are belt and braces.
///   - `standDown` records the handoff in the log, so the trace shows the corrector yielding — and,
///     as of Wave 9b, PERFORMS it: it notifies that row's belt directly, which hides the title
///     immediately instead of leaving it to time out. Device frame analysis (2026-08-31) showed the
///     Wave 9 fix working but with the timers visible — ~1-2s of title painted across the posters
///     at every deep rest before it vanished. That wait is right for a rest nothing has judged yet
///     and pure latency for one the corrector has just given up on, and `standDown` is only ever
///     reached from a debounced settle on a branch that has already concluded the rest cannot be
///     improved, so an immediate hide cannot pre-empt a correction that would have fixed it.
///   - `PinnedRowTitleTracking.fadeMaxDefer` bounds the belt's motion deferral absolutely. This is
///     the liveness guarantee: the belt fires within `fadeMaxDefer + fadeRecheckFloor` (2.6s) of
///     the title becoming unacceptable NO MATTER what the corrector, the focus engine, or lazy
///     layout are doing, so no future interaction between them can starve it again. The extra
///     `fadeRecheckFloor` is real and deliberate — the ceiling gates a scheduled CHECK rather than
///     firing a timer of its own, so the bound is the ceiling plus one wake-up interval.
///
/// Wave G adds the fourth: the budget and the pull-back detector both stand down, so a device that
/// fights corrections reaches the belt in two attempts instead of never.
///
/// The creep this also disposes of. The same sim trace shows `margin` drifting ~2pt per probe
/// tick at "rest" (−86 → −100 over ~600ms with no input), i.e. the rest never actually settles.
/// That drift is NOT produced by anything in this file: the slide is saturated at the cap, so
/// `PinnedRowTitleTracking` writes no state and its `visualEffect` is invisible to geometry by
/// construction (Codex gate 1, round 2) — there is no title-side feedback loop left to break. What
/// remains are three EXTERNAL movers, and the probe now carries the fields that tell them apart
/// (`vh=` here, `y=` on the `[HomeScrollProbe] pinned-hero` line): a scroll animation that never
/// converged (`y` drifts), content above the row still relaying out (`y` and `vh` hold, `margin`
/// drifts), or the pinned hero itself resizing (`vh` drifts — ruled out by reading, the header is
/// a fixed `heroCarouselHeightPinned` frame). Whichever it is, the drift is made HARMLESS here
/// rather than chased: `noteScroll` treats a sub-`driftTolerance` STEP as stillness, so a crawl
/// still produces exactly one settle instead of re-arming the debounce forever, and the correction
/// is computed from the LIVE measurement at fire time, not from the stale one that armed it. A
/// creep that outlives the correction is bounded three ways now: the band is 30pt wide at Large
/// and 74 at Small, so ordinary drift never leaves it; the wall-clock budget caps what a drifting
/// rest can cost; and a motionless pass no longer arms anything at all.
///
/// **The settle line** (`[HomeScrollProbe] settle …`, mirrored into the DEBUG `debug_pinned` AX
