// Phase 2/4 of the hybrid player: on-device MKV→fMP4 remux with an OWNED segmenter (plan decision D3).
// Stream-copies (no re-encode) the compatible video and audio tracks of a source into fragmented-MP4
// segments, preserving Dolby Vision (RPU NALs ride along in the copied bitstream; the `dvvC` box is
// written by movenc from the DOVI side data). Audio with no copyable track falls back to a TrueHD/DTS
// → AAC transcode (`AudioTranscoder`, Phase 4 v2). Runs on a background worker; the emitted directory
// — one init segment plus `seg-NNNNN.m4s` files — is served to AVPlayer by `LocalHLSServer`.
//
// WHY WE OWN THE SEGMENTER (not the `dash` muxer): tvOS 27 rejects EVENT/growing playlists and only
// plays a VOD playlist (EXT-X-ENDLIST) published complete up front — but the segment files must still
// be produced just-in-time (remux ≈ realtime for debrid sources). A complete up-front playlist and a
// third-party muxer's autonomous cut decisions can silently disagree (MKV Cues are often a sparse
// subset of real keyframes), and one mismatched boundary desyncs the whole tail unrecoverably. So we
// cut the fMP4 ourselves at the `SegmentMap`'s keyframe boundaries via the mov/mp4 muxer with
// `movflags frag_custom+empty_moov+default_base_moof` and a custom AVIO sink (`SegmentWriter`) that
// routes each fragment into its own atomically-renamed file. Published == produced by construction;
// sparse Cues just yield longer-but-valid segments. See docs/tvos-hybrid-player-plan.md.
//
// SEEK-ANYWHERE: production happens in repositionable RUNS. A request for a segment outside the
// current producing window makes the JIT server call `reposition(toSegment:)`: the worker abandons
// its partial fragment, seeks the (Range-capable HTTP) demuxer to that segment's boundary keyframe,
// and continues linearly from there with a fresh muxer context (`frag_discont` keeps tfdt absolute so
// every fragment lands at its published playlist time regardless of which run produced it). Unproduced
// holes are legal — a request into one triggers another reposition — and the worker parks at EOF
// instead of exiting so late back-seeks still work.
