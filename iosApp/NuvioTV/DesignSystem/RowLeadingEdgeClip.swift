/// BUG-92 (beta.18 follow-up): the tester's original report ("inline trailer on the GIGN card sits
/// offset — dark band between the [ring] and the video") was fixed by `InlineTrailerTileGeometry`
/// concentering the video inside the reserved ring band. A second report on the SAME bug number
/// followed: with **No Zoom ON** (`CardFocusButtonStyle` swaps to `StillCardButtonStyle` +
/// `.focusEffectDisabled(true)` — zero system lift, see `PosterCard.swift`), accent ring OFF, Card
/// Depth ON, the inline trailer spills past the poster's edge — but *only on the FIRST (left-most)
/// card of a row*.
///
/// Root cause: every catalog row's horizontal `ScrollView` carries `.scrollClipDisabled()`
/// (`BrowseComponents.swift` ~L3107) so a focused card's own lift/reach/ring bleed is never
/// clipped — by design: that bleed is meant to land OVER the focused card's left neighbour, which
/// is invisible because the neighbour is already there, drawn on top. The first card in a row has
/// no left neighbour. Its bleed lands on the empty overscan margin outside the row's own content
/// instead — nothing hides it there, which is exactly the "spills past the edge" the tester saw.
/// (`.shadow(...)` outside the tile's `.clipShape`, sub-pixel rounding in
/// `InlineTrailerTileGeometry.inner`, and the expanding tile's rightward growth were all
/// investigated as the source of the bleed itself; none of them are what makes it VISIBLE only on
/// card #1 — `.scrollClipDisabled()` is.)
///
/// `RowLeadingEdgeClip` clips ONLY the row's leading edge. Every other side is left ~2000pt open so
/// this can never accidentally reach into something BUG-92 was never about: a card's vertical lift,
/// the row's own top/bottom reach-band padding, or the inline-trailer morph's RIGHTWARD tile growth
/// (UX-4a). It composes with `.scrollClipDisabled()` as a single `.clipShape` on the row's
/// CONTENT — never on the `ScrollView` itself, which would silently undo
/// `.scrollClipDisabled()`'s whole effect for every other card in the row.
///
/// ## How BrowseComponents should attach this (NOT done here — a different wave owns that file)
///
/// Attach the clip to the `LazyHStack` — the `ScrollView`'s CONTENT — right where
/// `.scrollClipDisabled()` already lives, in `CatalogRowView.body` (`BrowseComponents.swift`
/// ~L3044-3107):
///
/// ```swift
/// LazyHStack(spacing: Theme.Spacing.rowGap) {
///     // ... ForEach(section.items) { ... }, the trailing "See All" card ...
/// }
/// .padding(.vertical, Theme.Spacing.lg)          // unchanged, already there
/// .clipShape(RowLeadingEdgeClip(allowance: leadingEdgeAllowance))   // NEW — attach here
/// .scrollClipDisabled()                          // unchanged, already there
/// ```
///
/// `leadingEdgeAllowance` needs two AppStorage reads `CatalogRowView` doesn't have yet
/// (`PosterCard.swift`'s own copies, same keys):
///
/// ```swift
/// @AppStorage("accent_focus_ring") private var accentFocusRing = false
/// @AppStorage("no_zoom_on_focus") private var noZoomOnFocus = false
///
/// private var leadingEdgeAllowance: CGFloat {
///     let posterWidth = posterStyle.landscapeCatalogRows ? Theme.Size.landscapeWidth : posterStyle.width
///     // No lift at all in No Zoom mode (`CardFocusMode.still`) — only the ring can bleed there.
///     // Otherwise this is `PosterCard.swift`'s own `cardLiftScale(artworkHeight:)` formula
///     // inlined — that function is `private` to PosterCard.swift, so this recomputes it from the
///     // SAME public constant (`Theme.Size.heroPinnedRowFocusLiftAllowance`) rather than exposing
///     // a new cross-file symbol for one call site. If `cardLiftScale` is ever made internal,
///     // prefer calling it directly instead of keeping two copies of this formula in sync by hand.
///     let liftScale = noZoomOnFocus ? 1 : 1 + 2 * Theme.Size.heroPinnedRowFocusLiftAllowance / rowArtworkHeight
///     // Mirrors PosterCard.swift's `ringInset(accentFocusRing:noZoomOnFocus:)` — either ring
///     // reserves the same band.
///     let ring: CGFloat = (accentFocusRing || noZoomOnFocus) ? ringWidth : 0
///     return RowLeadingEdgeClip.allowance(posterWidth: posterWidth, liftScale: liftScale, ringWidth: ring)
/// }
/// ```

/// (`rowArtworkHeight` and `posterStyle` are both already properties of `CatalogRowView`;
/// `ringWidth` is `PosterCard.swift`'s top-level constant, already visible module-wide.)
