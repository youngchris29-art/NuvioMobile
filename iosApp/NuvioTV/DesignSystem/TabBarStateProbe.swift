/// BUG-66 (u/mrStevenx3, open since beta.13): on his Apple TV the system tab bar never minimizes
/// when Home scrolls; the simulator's does. `.tabBarMinimizeBehavior` is unavailable on tvOS and
/// nothing in the app has ever captured the bar's actual state on hardware — the existing
/// `TabBarProbe` (`TabBarVisibility.swift`, the About pane's "Tab Bar Diagnostics" toggle) only
/// ever read a scroll-view's own offset/inset, which tracks the HYSTERESIS this app applies, not
/// whether the SYSTEM bar itself visually minimized. This probe records the bar's own GEOMETRY
/// over time — read straight off the live `UITabBar`, the way `SidebarOverlay`'s
/// `HiddenTabBarFocusBlocker` locates it — so a photo of the About pane answers, for the first
/// time, whether the bar ever minimizes on the device and what Home's scroll state was when it
/// did or did not. Diagnostics only: it installs nothing that changes layout or focus.
///
/// Deliberately its own type, key, and toggle rather than folding into `TabBarProbe` above:
/// that probe's contract is a live in-memory counter snapshot with no persistence (see its own
/// doc comment — "nothing here touches UserDefaults"), while this one needs the exact
/// `PinnedRowSettleProbe` head-preserving persisted-buffer shape (armed at launch, survives a
/// backgrounding between the walk and reaching Settings, paged for the same clipped-`List`-row
/// reason BUG-100/102 fixed there). Mixing the two shapes into one type would have meant either
/// persisting the live counters (a contract `TabBarProbe`'s own doc comment explicitly says it
/// does not have) or losing this probe's relaunch-survivable buffer.
///
/// NAMING NOTE (implementer's judgment call, 2026-09-10): the About pane already has a toggle
/// titled "Tab Bar Diagnostics" bound to the persisted key `debug.tabBarProbe` (driving
/// `TabBarProbe` above), and `Localizable.xcstrings` already carries fr/de/es/it/vi translations
/// for that exact string. This probe therefore uses a distinct toggle title ("Tab Bar Geometry
/// Diagnostics") and a distinct persisted key (`debug.tabBarStateProbe`) so the two features never
/// collide — same About pane, two different rows, two different photographable protocols.
///
/// Line format (one per sample, newest first in the pane once paged the way
/// `PinnedRowSettleProbe.displayPages` already does):
///     minY=<pt> h=<pt> alpha=<0.00-1.00> hidden=<0/1> minimized=<0/1> scrolledDown=<0/1>
///     mode=<classic|sidebar> reason=<arm|tick|down|up>
/// `t=<ms since arm>` is realized as the standard `<N>ms ` prefix `log(_:)` stamps on every line —
/// the same convention `PinnedRowSettleProbe.log` uses (its own call sites never repeat the
/// timestamp again inline either) — rather than a duplicated inline field. `minimized` is derived:
/// the bar's frame (converted to window coordinates) has moved so its top edge is past half its
/// own height above the window's bottom edge (`minY > screenH - h/2`). `scrolledDown`/`mode` are
/// fed in by `TabBarVisibility.swift`'s `TabBarScrollAutoHide` on a real hysteresis crossing (see
/// `noteScrollState` below) and held for every sample taken after that until the next crossing.
/// `mode` can only distinguish `sidebar`/`classic` at that call site (`SidebarChrome.isEnabled()`)
/// — there is no separate "pinned" tab-bar concept reachable from there, so the spec's third value
/// is never emitted; this is a deliberate simplification, not an oversight. Samples on every
/// scroll-state crossing and every 2 s otherwise.
