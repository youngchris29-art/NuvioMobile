/// `SagaCard` (the description page's franchise/saga row, the original FEAT-34 use — a
/// `LazyHStack` recycling a card's view identity while scrolling must never re-issue the same
/// lookup) and `HomeView`'s `HeroArtResolver`/`HomeHeroFocusModel` (FEAT-42 — the Home hero/focus
/// panel's own title-logo resolution, added without widening `MetaPreview` or the shared Kotlin
/// enrichment payload; see `HeroArtResolver.logoPlan` and `HomeHeroFocusModel.requestLogoIfNeeded`
/// in `HomeView.swift`). Scoped as a process-wide singleton (mirrors `ArtworkStore`'s own
/// in-memory cache) rather than per-view state, since the same title can be looked up from more
/// than one surface (a saga-row part that is ALSO a Home catalog item, say).
///
/// Moved out of `SagaCard.swift` (where it lived as `SagaLogoStore`, FEAT-34) and renamed for
/// FEAT-42 now that a second, unrelated view owns a client of its own — no typealias shim, every
/// call site was updated in the same change.
///
/// Every mounted `SagaCard` holds `@ObservedObject private var logoStore = TitleLogoStore.shared`,
/// so ANY `results` mutation (any card's lookup resolving) republishes to every saga card on
/// screen, not just the one that changed — `@Published` on a dictionary has no per-key
/// granularity. Each card's own re-render is cheap (`logoURL(for:)` is a dictionary lookup keyed
/// off its own item + the current scope), so this is a non-issue at saga-row scale. `HomeView`'s
/// Home-path consumers (`HeroArtResolver`, `HomeHeroFocusModel`) deliberately do NOT hold this as
/// an `@ObservedObject` — see the FEAT-42 rule in `HomeView.swift`'s `HeroArtResolver.present`
/// doc: they read it synchronously (`logoURL(for:)`/`isLookupPending(for:)`) or await one specific
