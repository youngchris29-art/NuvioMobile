/// BUG-87 (beta.18): structural fit for the PINNED rows layout.
///
/// One place that answers "how tall is the thing the focus engine reveals, and does it fit in the
/// viewport it has to rest inside" — and, when it does not, which of the three dials the layout
/// owns should be spent to make it fit.
///
/// ## The defect this closes
///
/// Every tvOS scroll is reveal-driven: the focus engine scrolls so that the focused card's LINK
/// FRAME is on screen. In pinned mode that frame is not the artwork — the reach bands live INSIDE
/// the `Button`/`NavigationLink` label (`BrowseComponents`, `CatalogRowView`'s `.padding(.top,
/// cardTopReach)` / `.padding(.bottom, cardBottomReach)`), so the revealed extent is
///
///     linkFrame = topReach + artwork + captionChrome + bottomReach
///
/// Wave 10's hero compression, however, was sized against a DIFFERENT quantity — `Spacing.lg +
/// topReach + artwork + cushion` — which charges neither the caption nor the downward reach. At
/// Poster Size = Large with Hide Labels ON that is a 535.3pt frame against a 523.3pt viewport: 12pt
/// over, and 55.5pt over with captions. An over-tall frame has TWO legal rests (the simulator
/// top-anchors it, hardware bottom-anchors it ~75pt deeper), the settle corrector chases whichever
/// one it did not get, and the tester sees row titles that "keep trying to move back" (BUG-87), a
/// title glitch during horizontal travel (BUG-88), and a second-to-last row that regresses after a
/// Medium → Large switch until the app is restarted (BUG-89).
///
/// Christian approved the structural fix: make the frame FIT, so the engine has exactly one rest
/// and the corrector has nothing to correct.
///
/// ## What gets spent, and in what order
///
/// Three dials, each a pure `min`. The REACHES are spent first, down to their floors, and the hero
/// compression takes only what is left:
///
///  1. **The downward reach** (`heroPinnedRowBottomReach` 44 → `bottomReachFloor` 24, 20pt of
///     give). It covers the mirror-direction rest error and has no content to protect below it, so
///     it is the cheapest dial in the file.
///  2. **The upward reach** (`heroPinnedRowTopPad` 88 → `topReachFloor(lift:titleHeight:)`, 22pt of
///     give with No Zoom on and 2pt with either zoom mode in the system font). It is never RAISED
///     here, only lowered, and never below the floor: `heroPinnedRowTitleInset` (48) + the ACTIVE
///     font's measured title line (38 system, ≈42.2 Open Sans) − `Spacing.lg` (24) holds the TITLE,
///     and the floor adds the focus lift and the belt's `fadeIntrusionArm` on top of it — see
///     `topReachFloor(lift:titleHeight:)` and the rc10 note below.
///  3. **Hero compression**, for whatever demand the two reaches could not cover, bounded by what
///     the pinned hero's internals can actually yield
///     (`Theme.Size.heroPinnedCompressionCap(showsCTA:)`).
///
/// ### Why this order (rc2 tester feedback, 2026-09-06)
///
/// The first cut of this file spent compression FIRST, on the reasoning that the hero's elastic
/// slots cost nothing structural while the reaches are the app's most regression-prone dials. At
/// the tester's shape that produced a 112.33pt compression, and the FEAT-15 focus panel spends
/// compression out of its synopsis slot first: 144 − min(112.33, 108) = 36pt of slot (the last
/// 4.33 came out of the logo), one line of description where beta.17 showed three. He filmed it and objected — "one line is not enough". Christian's
/// decision: keep the three lines, spend the two reach cushions instead. Both cushions exist to
/// absorb REST ERROR, and the whole point of this file is that a frame which fits has exactly one
/// rest and therefore no error to absorb; the compression's cost, by contrast, is content the
/// viewer reads. Spending the reaches first drops the tester's compression to 68.33 — Wave 10's own
/// Large number, the one beta.17 shipped and he never complained about — and the panel is back to
/// three lines.
///
/// ### The trade this order makes — rc4's open question, ANSWERED (rc10, BUG-87/89)
///
/// rc4 shipped a flat `topReachFloor` of 64 and this header said so plainly: it sat BELOW the
/// long-proven 72, it left the settled title a **2pt** static clearance rather than BUG-53's 26, and
/// with No Zoom OFF "there is [a lift], and nothing here proves the outcome". The tester's rc8 Row
/// Settle pane proved it, and the outcome was bad: at Large with zoom on, `staticClearance` 2 minus
/// the 20pt lift is **−18** — the focused card's artwork permanently 18pt over the settled title's
/// bottom — and `PinnedRowTitle.Clearances`' `max(…, 0)` reported it as a clean **0**. That single
/// clamp is why the defect read as a scroll problem for a whole release: `PinnedRowSettle`'s
/// `bandLow` became 0, which excluded the hardware's own bottom-anchored rest (≈ −31) by ~30pt, so
/// nearly every visit fired a correction (`UNEXPECTED-WITH-FIT`, nudges −12/−94/+27) that could only
/// swap one out-of-band rest for another; the belt, measuring intrusion against the same 0, faded
/// the titles it could not help (`clearanceLift=0` on every belt line of that pane).
///
/// Christian's decision: **take the clearance.** The floor is now derived, MODE-AWARE and
/// FONT-AWARE — `topReachFloor(lift:titleHeight:)` = title inset 48 + the active font's measured
/// title line − `Spacing.lg` 24 + the active lift + the belt's `fadeIntrusionArm` (4) — which in the
/// system font is 66 with No Zoom on and **86** with either zoom mode. 86 is back INSIDE the proven
/// 72-88 corridor, so rc4's "is 64 safe?" question is retired rather than doubled, and the settled
/// focused title clears the artwork by 4pt (one arm width) in BOTH modes by construction instead of
/// by luck.
///
/// The font term is the rc10 Codex P2 half of the same defect: the floor reserved a hard-coded 38pt
/// title while the clearance it protects is measured live, so FEAT-31's Open Sans (≈42.2pt at the
/// same text style) reproduced the negative `focusedRaw` the derived floor exists to remove — and the
/// `LIFT-DEFICIT` stand-down with it. Open Sans + zoom on now wants 90.2 and takes the 88 cap, which
/// leaves 1.8pt of clearance: positive, so the corrector keeps working, but inside the belt's arm
/// band. See `topReachFloor(lift:titleHeight:)` for that trade and for where the stand-down is still
/// the right answer (titles past ≈44pt, i.e. accessibility text sizes).
///
/// The price is paid in hero compression: at Large + Hide Labels + panel it goes 68.33 → **90.33**
/// with zoom on (70.33 with No Zoom), which takes the panel's synopsis from 3 lines to 2 in both
/// modes. That cost is real and is documented at `topReachFloor(lift:)`; the dial to move if the
/// third line has to come back is `heroPinnedFrameSlack` or `HeroSlotGive`'s tier-3 gate, never this
/// floor. Two things the device pass still owns, both narrower than rc4's: that focus never
/// hesitates at reach 86/66 (both inside the corridor, so this is a sanity check), and that the hero
/// at the deeper compression still reads acceptably.
///
/// ## Unsatisfiable by design
///
/// Large + captions + carousel hero demands ~155.8pt against 44pt of reach give and an elastic give
/// of ~70 — 114 against 156. That case CANNOT be made to fit and is not pretended otherwise: the
/// plan reports `fits == false`, returns TODAY'S numbers verbatim (Wave 10's compression, reach
/// 88/44) so the belt regime is bit-identical to beta.17, and logs once per regime. A too-tall row
/// costs a hidden row title, never a broken hero — the same handoff contract `PinnedRowSettle` and
/// the visibility belt have always had.
///
/// ## Scope gate — Small and Medium are untouched
///
/// The plan spends NOTHING at a Poster Size whose row already fits Wave 10's own extent rule, i.e.
/// wherever `PinnedRowTitle.pinnedHeroCompression` computes 0 today: Small (395), Medium (450) and
/// landscape catalog rows (323), all under the 455 budget, at EVERY flag combination. That is a
/// deliberate scope decision, not an oversight — Medium is the default Poster Size with captions
/// ON, its device/sim band table records zero corrections, and keying its compression to the link
/// frame would silently compress the default configuration's hero by ~82pt to fix a rest nobody has
/// reported. The structural fix applies to the sizes that were ALREADY compressing, which is
/// exactly the population that reports the bug.
///
/// The gate reads through `PinnedRowTitle.pinnedHeroCompression`, so `-debug.pinnedHeroCompressionOff`
/// (test48's historical-geometry knob) keeps working unchanged: with the knob set the legacy
/// compression is 0 everywhere, the gate stays shut, and every plan returns the pre-Wave-10 reaches
/// and viewport.

    /// `testPanelAtStevensCompressionKeepsThreeSynopsisLines` was written to guard, crossed by a
    /// third of a point. Zoom on spends 22 more and lands at 2 lines outright (slot 87.67). So both
    /// modes now show a 2-line description where rc4 showed 3. Christian's decision was to take the
    /// clearance knowing the hero pays for it; if the third line has to come back, the dial to move
    /// is `heroPinnedFrameSlack` or the tier-3 gate in `HeroSlotGive`, NOT this floor — lowering the
    /// floor again reinstates the permanent title-on-artwork overlap this whole change removes.
    ///
    /// Capped at `heroPinnedRowTopPad`: this dial only ever moves DOWN (reach 100 kills focus
    /// resolution outright). 86 also lands INSIDE the proven 72-88 corridor, so the rc4 header's
    /// unanswered hardware questions about reach 64 are retired rather than doubled.
    ///
    /// ### `titleHeight` is the ACTIVE FONT's metric, not a constant (rc10 Codex P2)
    ///
    /// The first cut of this floor hard-coded 38 — the system font's `sectionTitle` line as measured
    /// on the FA87 fixture — while the clearance it is supposed to reserve room for
    /// (`PinnedRowTitle.staticClearance`) is computed from the title's LIVE measured height. Under
    /// FEAT-31's Open Sans the two disagree by ≈4pt (42.2 against 38), which is the entire margin
    /// this floor keeps, so at Large with zoom on the derived reach of 86 left
    /// `atRest = (24 + 86) − (48 + 42.2) = 19.8`, `focusedRaw = −0.2` — negative, i.e. the corrector's
    /// `LIFT-DEFICIT` stand-down, permanently, for the session, on a font the app ships. The default
    /// is therefore `Theme.Font.sectionTitleLineHeight`, measured from the face the token actually
    /// resolves to. A DEFAULT ARGUMENT rather than a read inside the body, so the unit suite can pin
    /// a fixed height and assert numbers instead of following whatever family the host has applied —
    /// which is also why that metric is the one `Theme.Font` member declared `nonisolated(unsafe)`:
    /// a nonisolated function's default value expression may not touch main-actor state.
    ///
    /// ### At the 88 cap the belt's arm is no longer guaranteed — by design
    ///
    /// Open Sans + zoom on wants `48 + 42.2 − 24 + 20 + 4 = 90.2` and gets the cap, 88. The settled
    /// focused title then clears the artwork by `24 + 88 − 48 − 42.2 − 20 = 1.8`: still POSITIVE, so
    /// the geometry is legible and the corrector keeps working (`focusedRaw >= 0`, no stand-down, and
    /// the band the corrector aims into is simply 2.2pt narrower at its low edge), but under
    /// `fadeIntrusionArm`, so the belt may arm on a rest that is technically clear. That is the right
    /// trade at the cap: the alternative is a reach past 88, which kills focus resolution outright.

    /// Resolves one regime. Pure: the same inputs always produce an equal `Plan` (the probe log
    /// below is fire-once-per-regime and has no effect on the value).
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - posterHeight: `PosterStyle.height` — the tallest artwork a PORTRAIT pinned row presents.
    ///   - captionVisible: `PosterStyle.showTitle` (Hide Labels OFF).
    ///   - showsCTA: whether the pinned hero renders its CTA, i.e. the carousel form. False is
    ///     FEAT-15's focus panel, which has a larger synopsis slot and therefore more give.
    ///   - landscapeRows: `PosterStyle.landscapeCatalogRows`. Landscape catalog rows are 203pt tall,
    ///     so nothing needs to be spent for them. NOTE: a collection row whose folders keep the
    ///     portrait shape still presents `posterHeight`-tall tiles in this mode
    ///     (`FolderTile.artworkHeight`), and such a row is over-tall here exactly as it is at Medium
    ///     today — the belt owns it. Compressing a hero by ~112pt for a page whose catalog rows are
    ///     203pt tall would be the worse trade.
    ///   - mode: the two Appearance flags `PinnedRowTitle.focusLiftAllowance` branches on. The plan
    ///     is MODE-DEPENDENT as of BUG-87/89 rc10 — the top reach's floor has to hold the focus lift
    ///     — so a caller inside SwiftUI must pass `@AppStorage`-backed flags rather than let the
    ///     `.current` default latch whatever the defaults said last (the Codex r10 P2 staleness
    ///     class, closed for `PinnedRowTitleTracking` and closed here the same way).
    ///   - titleHeight: the rendered height of ONE `Theme.Font.sectionTitle` line, which the top
    ///     reach's floor has to reserve room for. Defaults to the ACTIVE font family's measured
    ///     metric (`Theme.Font.sectionTitleLineHeight`) — the plan is font-dependent for the same
    ///     reason it is mode-dependent, and a hard-coded 38 stood the corrector down under Open Sans
    ///     (see `topReachFloor(lift:titleHeight:)`). Tests pass a fixed number so their arithmetic
    ///     does not depend on the host's font.
    ///
    ///     `regimeKey` also takes this parameter and encodes it (rc10 Codex P2 fix 4): the plan has
