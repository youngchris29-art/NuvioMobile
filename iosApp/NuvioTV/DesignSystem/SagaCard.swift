/// FEAT-34 (2026-09-08, Christian's decision): the description page's saga/franchise row (e.g.
/// "Avatar - Saga") the way official Nuvio renders it — 16:9 backdrop cards with the franchise's
/// title-logo art composited bottom-leading over the artwork, film name + year captioned
/// underneath. Tester photo:
/// `docs/research/steven-beta18-photos/2026-09-08-official-nuvio-saga-row-landscape.jpg` (outer
/// repo). Replaces the plain portrait `PosterCard` the row used before, which carried no logo art
/// and put the whole film name in a single caption line under a poster crop.
///
/// `LandscapeCard` (`PosterCard.swift`, the existing 16:9 card used by Upcoming/Continue
/// Watching) has no artwork-overlay slot and this task is scoped to `SagaCard.swift` + the
/// collection row only — no `PosterCard.swift` edits — so composing `LandscapeCard` with a new
/// closure parameter isn't an option here. This view is a sibling that copies `LandscapeCard`'s
/// minimal focus/depth/shape chain (`CardArtworkFocusLift`, `CardFocusTreatment`,
/// `CardCaptionFocusDrop`, `nuvioCardDepth`, the `@Environment(\.posterStyle)` corner radius, and
/// the `accent_focus_ring` / `no_zoom_on_focus` `@AppStorage` reads — same keys, same behavior)
/// rather than reusing `LandscapeCard` itself, and adds its own artwork-overlay logo/text and an
/// always-shown two-line caption in place of `LandscapeCard`'s badges/progress bar.
///
/// Sized larger than `LandscapeCard`: `Theme.Size.sagaCardWidth` × `Theme.Size.sagaCardHeight`
/// (500×281, 16:9), `style.cornerRadius` from Poster Style. FEAT-34 follow-up (2026-09-09):

/// Christian's call was a dedicated, larger size for this card only. rc8's 440×248 was still
