/// the actually-selected tab's real position. It was also long dead for the bar's OWN
/// presentation — round 4 (below, `immersiveHidden`) already stopped the toolbar from reading
/// `hidden` at all. The only real consumer was `isScrolledDown` (BUG-27's Menu-to-top signal),
/// and that was already correctly served by `TabBarScrollAutoHide`'s own per-tab
/// `@State private var hidesBar` — one latch per tab root, not one shared across all four.

/// state and always was.

/// `detailDepth`: count of "immersive" pushed screens (currently just `DetailView`) stacked on
/// top of the active tab's `NavigationStack`. A depth counter rather than a `Bool` because
/// Detail → More Like This → Detail nests — the bar should only reappear once every pushed
/// immersive screen has been popped, not after the first one.
