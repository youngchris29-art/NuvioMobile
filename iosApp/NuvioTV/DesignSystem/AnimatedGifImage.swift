/// Renders an animated GIF as a looping `UIImageView`, with the folder's static cover art shown

///
/// Ported from the mobile Kotlin/Native reference,
/// `composeApp/src/iosMain/kotlin/com/nuvio/app/features/home/components/CollectionCardRemoteImage.ios.kt`:
/// `gifImageWithData` (ImageIO frame extraction + `UIImage.animatedImage(with:duration:)`),

/// play back correctly on a single fixed-duration `UIImage` animation).

/// BUG-19 (4th attempt — the first three moved decode work around without removing the actual
/// main-thread cost per focus step). The measured symptom was a 700–830 ms freeze of EVERY visible
/// tile on each D-pad step, i.e. a main-thread hang, not a slow animation. Four levers, all of
/// which had to land together:
///   1. the GIF `URLSession`'s `URLCache` had no `directory:`, so it silently had no disk tier at
///      all (same defect ArtworkStore hit — see the `session` comment below);
///   2. the memory cache's cost accounting made every realistic entry larger than the whole
///      budget, so it was evicted on insert and the "cached" path never hit (see `AnimatedGifCache`);
///   3. fetch + cache-write ran on the main actor (only the CGImage expansion hopped off);
///   4. the view was mounted/unmounted by focus, so every step tore down a whole pipeline (freeing
///      the expanded frame array on the main thread in `dismantleUIView`) and built a new one.
/// The view is now mounted for the tile's whole lifetime and focus only toggles
