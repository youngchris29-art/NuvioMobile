/// Unit tests for BUG-95 (beta.18) — Steven's report: "when the image that needs to be displayed
/// is not the same size as the previous one, it waits until we move onto it before
/// repositioning/cropping itself, so we see the repositioning happen." Filmed on a folder backdrop
/// with Show Hero off (the FEAT-15 focus panel, `nuvioStyle` forced on): blank panel with plain
/// text title → logo crossfading in → the folder's mosaic backdrop appears heavily cropped →
/// settles less cropped ~35 frames later.
///
/// Root cause (`Screens/HomeView.swift`): `HeroCrossfadeImage.body` is a `ZStack` whose only
/// children were the optional `current`/`previous` `Image`s. With neither resolved yet (a folder
/// hero's very first paint, mid-fetch — `HeroArtResolver.folderDeadline` is 1.5s), the ZStack had
/// NO children at all and so no size of its own; a childless SwiftUI stack ignores whatever size
/// its parent proposes and reports its own minimal default instead. The moment the first bitmap
/// landed, the stack gained its first real child and its size jumped from that collapsed default
/// straight to the full proposed frame — inside `HeroArtResolver.commit`'s `withAnimation`, so
/// SwiftUI interpolated the jump and `.scaledToFill()` computed its crop against a box that was
/// still growing on every intermediate frame of that 0.3s animation.
///
/// The fix adds a `Color.clear` ZStack child in `HeroCrossfadeImage.body`: a `Color` always reports
/// the FULL proposed size regardless of whether any bitmap sibling exists, so the ZStack's own size
/// is now invariant across every state the crossfade passes through. These tests probe the ACTUAL
/// SwiftUI layout algorithm via `UIHostingController.sizeThatFits(in:)` (no window or app launch
/// needed) rather than a hand-written stand-in for it — the bug lived entirely in how SwiftUI sizes
/// a stack with a `Color.clear` child versus without one, which is not arithmetic this file owns,
/// so a pure math helper could not have caught a regression here.
